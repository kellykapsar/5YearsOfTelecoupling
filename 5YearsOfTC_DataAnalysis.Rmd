##Preliminaries

#Clear memory
rm(list=ls())

#Import libraries
library(tidyverse) 

#Set working directory
setwd("C:/Users/Kelly Kapsar/Documents/MSU/Five Years of Telecoupling Chapter")


#Select the location in which you have saved the csv file
lit <- read.csv("TelecouplingPapers_20180610.csv")

lit <- as.tibble(lit)


```

## Purpose

This is an R Markdown document that illustrates the data cleaning process for the data collected as a part of the literature review portion of the Five Years of Telecoupling manuscript. The purpose of this document is to create a clean and standardized dataset from which to interpret the findings of the literature review and to demonstrate some preliminary results.


## Data Cleaning 

```{r}

#list of columns to remove
rem <- c(1,4,5,6,8,12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19:34)

#remove unnecessary columns
lit <- lit[,-rem]

#column names
#names(lit) -- original names

new.names <- c("Title","Authors","Source.Title","Yr","Vol","Issue","
               DOI","Geo.Scale","Countries","Num.Countries","Regions",
               "System.Type","Meas.Unit","Time.Period","Conc.Empir","Comp.ID",
               "Comp.Analyzed","Flow.Type","Flow.Type.Stats","Scholar.Cite",
               "WOS.Cite","Discipline","Quant.Meth","Qual.Meth","Future","Notes")

colnames(lit) <- new.names

#put all characters into lower case
lit$Source.Title <- tolower(lit$Source.Title)
lit$Countries <- tolower(lit$Countries)
lit$Geo.Scale <- tolower(lit$Geo.Scale)
lit$System.Type <- tolower(lit$System.Type)
lit$Meas.Unit <- tolower(lit$Meas.Unit)
lit$Conc.Empir <- tolower(lit$Conc.Empir)
lit$Comp.Analyzed <- tolower(lit$Comp.Analyzed)
lit$Comp.ID <- tolower(lit$Comp.ID)
lit$Flow.Type <- tolower(lit$Flow.Type)
lit$Flow.Type.Stats <- tolower(lit$Flow.Type.Stats)
lit$Discipline <- tolower(lit$Discipline)
lit$Quant.Meth <- tolower(lit$Quant.Meth)
lit$Qual.Meth <- tolower(lit$Qual.Meth)

#Replace "country" with "national" for the Geo.Scale column
lit$Geo.Scale <- gsub("country","national",lit$Geo.Scale)

#Identify and separate non-telecoupling papers into 
#their own dataframe (based on lit$Notes)
nottc <- c(1,3,5,9,13,14,16,19,20,21,25,32,
           33,36,37,38,50,52,56,58,59,73,78)

length(nottc) 
#23 papers found to use the word telecoupling, but do not apply 
#the telecoupling framework in a conceptual or empirical way. 

tc <- lit[-nottc,] #remove non-tc papers from dataframe
nottc <- lit[nottc,] #change from a list of row nums to a df w/ only the non-tc papers


#One paper, Liu et al. 2015 was marked as empirical, 
#however the empirical analyses were not framed
#according to the telecoupling framework and 
#therefore I changed it to conceptual 
tc$Conc.Empir[60] <- "conceptual"

#Separate conceptual and empirical tc papers
tc.emp <- tc[grep("emp", tc$Conc.Empir),]
tc.conc <- tc[grep("conc", tc$Conc.Empir),]
tc.both <- tc[intersect(grep("emp", tc$Conc.Empir), 
                        grep("conc",tc$Conc.Empir)),]

#Visually inspected tc.conc and tc.emp to validate sorting. 
#ID'd one paper that needs to be removed from "emp"
tc.emp <- tc.emp[-18,]
tc.both <- tc.both[-7,] #remove same paper from "both" dataframe

#Note that all of the articles in the "tc.both" 
#data frame are repeated in the "tc.conc" and "tc.emp" data frames
length(tc.emp$Title) + length(tc.conc$Title) - 
  length(tc.both$Title) == length(tc$Title)



```

## Some preliminary stats

```{r}
length(unique(tc$Source.Title)) 
#36 unique locations in which telecoupling articles have been published
```

Can also be written as text: Telecoupling studies have been published in `r length(unique(tc$Source.Title))` different locations (i.e. journals, books, etc.). 

```{r}
length(grep("internat",tc.emp$Geo.Scale))
length(grep("internat",tc.emp$Geo.Scale))/length(tc.emp$Geo.Scale)
#54.8% of all empirical telecoupling studies were conducted at the international scale 

length(grep("internat",tc$Geo.Scale))
length(grep("internat",tc$Geo.Scale))/length(tc$Geo.Scale)
#54.8% of all empirical telecoupling studies were conducted at the international scale 

length(grep("china",tc$Countries))
length(grep("agric",tc$System.Type))

length(grep("local",tc.emp$Geo.Scale))/length(tc.emp$Geo.Scale)
#13.3% of all empirical telecoupling studies were conducted at the local scale 

length(which(tc.emp$Num.Countries == 1))
#6 empirical studies conducted on only 1 country 

length(grep("trade",tc$Flow.Type.Stats))
length(grep("trade",tc$Flow.Type.Stats))/length(tc$Flow.Type.Stats)
#68% of all tc studies focus on trade 

length(grep("trade",tc.emp$Flow.Type.Stats))
length(grep("trade",tc.emp$Flow.Type.Stats))/length(tc.emp$Flow.Type.Stats)
#73% of empirical studies focus on trade
